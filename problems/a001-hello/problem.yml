title: Hello!

    As a good programmer, you should always say "Hello!" to anyone who you meet.
    But also, as a programmer, you don't want to waste your time saying "Hello!" by yourself.
    So, you should write a program that does the job for you.

input: |
    There is only one line of input: the name of the person you want to say "Hello!" to.
    The length of the name is no more than **1024** characters.
output: |
    Your program should output `Hello, <name>!` to the standard output.

examples:
    - input: |
          Jacob
      output: |
          Hello, Jacob!
    - input: |
          Takala
      output: |
          Hello, Takala!
    - input: |
          Open Judge
      output: |
          Hello, Open Judge!

      constraint: There is no space in the input.
      weight: 0.5
      testcases: ./testcases/subtask-1
    - title: Subtask 2
      constraint: Good luck! No more constraints.
      weight: 0.5
      testcases: ./testcases/subtask-2

hint:
    - You should also take care about spaces!
    - "`scanf` is a useful function to read input."
    - Try to google "%[^\n]%*c" to learn more magic about `scanf`.
