    Counting is a very important skill in programming.
    Counting from 1 to 10 is easy, but counting for a wide range becomes more difficult.
    You should write a program to count for you.

input: |
    There are 3 numbers in the input.
    The first number is the start number.
    The second number is the end number.
    The third number is the step number.
output: |
    Your program should output the numbers from the start number to the end number, with the step number.

examples:
    - input: |
          1 5 1
      output: |
          1 2 3 4 5
    - input: |
          1 10 2
      output: |
          1 3 5 7 9
    - input: |
          10 1 -1
      output: |
          10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

subtasks:
    - constraint: Numbers are in the range of `[1, 1000]`. Step is always `1`.
      weight: 0.3
      testcases: ./testcases/subtask-1
    - constraint: Numbers are in the range of `[-100000, 100000]`.
      weight: 0.3
      testcases: ./testcases/subtask-2
    - constraint: Numbers are in the range of `[-1000000000000, 1000000000000]`.
      weight: 0.4
      testcases: ./testcases/subtask-3

hint:
    - "`1000000000000` is larger than `2147483647`."
